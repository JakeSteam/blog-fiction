### **P**ush

Story told through git commits, although perhaps simplified to be less cryptic. Software is planned, written, and deployed that ultimately self replicates and adapts beyond all counter measures. A multi author story, perhaps could be shared as a real git repo.

### **Q**ueen

Pop-star / social media icon "stan" account dives deep into obsession, forming a network of sockpuppets growing in volume until the original fans are disillusioned. As the icon becomes concerned, a parasitic symbiotic relationship forms, with only one realistic conclusion: mental collapse of both. Told via Instagram posts(?).

### **R**e-elect

Rise of an unsavoury political party (cult?), as told through newspaper cuttings over time. Whilst left and right wing papers may originally differ, these opinions will converge as the party outstrips both.

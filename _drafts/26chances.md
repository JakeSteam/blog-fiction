This project aims to familiarise myself with fiction writing by utilising different formats, styles, and topics, whilst remaining guided by an overall theme: The demise of all involved, one way or another.

### **C**onflict

A look inside the Google Calendar of an engineer within a startup aims to grow whilst suffering funding issues, with a few preventable events impacting team morale, relationships, and ability to work. No startup survives a lack of funding and a lack of motivation.

### **F**ungibility

Mind-altering fungal outbreak within an isolated community, with only the remains discovered. Impact related to alignment of thought, hence fungibility. Written in academic paper format, including realistic biology and biochemistry. Request for further funding, to analyse found potentially live material.

### **M**utual

A series of unfortunate misunderstandings during military drills result in mutually assured destruction finally occurring. Story is told entirely via dialogue in nuclear submarines, early warning systems, etc. Only the Western side of the story is told, assumptions based on incomplete information is the cause of the problem as well as the way it is told.

### **P**ush

Story told through git commits, although perhaps simplified to be less cryptic. Software is planned, written, and deployed that ultimately self replicates and adapts beyond all counter measures. A multi author story, perhaps could be shared as a real git repo.

### **Q**ueen

Pop-star / social media icon "stan" account dives deep into obsession, forming a network of sockpuppets growing in volume until the original fans are disillusioned. As the icon becomes concerned, a parasitic symbiotic relationship forms, with only one realistic conclusion: mental collapse of both. Told via Instagram posts(?).

### **R**e-elect

Rise of an unsavoury political party (cult?), as told through newspaper cuttings over time. Whilst left and right wing papers may originally differ, these opinions will converge as the party outstrips both.

### [*Z*zz](/zzz)

Recurring themes within multiple person's dreams, told via medical reports of behaviour during sleep & reported experience. There's a few growing differences, with behaviour during sleep becoming more and more aligned. Perhaps the individuals in the study have something in common.

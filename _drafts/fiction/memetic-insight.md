Fragments around how the government uses emoji variants to monitor social circles and creativity within closed networks.

*Note: My lawyers have advised me to state that this is a fictional conspiracy theory. and not to be taken seriously. Make up your own mind.*

## What emojis do you use?

Emojis are not a new idea, they've been mainstream for a couple of decades by now. Whether it's a classic 🙂, a sarcastic 🆗, or a bland corporate 👍, they are a form social communication.

## Who taught you emojish?

So where did you pick up these emojis, and learn how to speak emojish? Your social circles. The same emoji can mean one thing to you, and something completely different to another person, even if they are geographically close to you.

**Is it a coincidence** that a new form of language evolved, conveniently in an easily analysable form that is accessible to all ages, education levels, and incomes? No, it's not. 

## The government are watching

Every time you use an emoji, any emoji, you are being tracked. Ever heard of tracking pixels AKA **[spy pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_pixel)**? They are tiny, invisible pixels placed in emails to monitor if you've seen them or not. These are used by every marketing company, but they make the foolish mistake of being easily detected and blocked.

You know what isn't blocked? Emojis! Everyone wants to see them, everyone wants to include them in their emails and messages. Every time you see one, a server has registered that you've received it. 

## The government are analysing

Maybe you're naive enough to think that this sounds somewhat innocent. Sure, images get loaded from servers, what's the big deal? Well, never heard of **big data**? 

By automatically analysing all your messages, and seeing which emojis you send and receive, your social circle can be mapped in extreme detail, and you can be [fingerprinted and identified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) as an individual. 

Think you're smart because you've got a burner phone on an anonymous SIM card? Wrong! Your emojis give you away! Every 😃 and 😭 betrays you, and those you communicate with.

Fragments around yet another sleepless night, as the immense weight full of potential energy stumbles and falls.

## The Plane

The crumbs fell between the slats of the bench, each causing a minor revolution in the social network represented by every stumble and every peck of every scarred pigeon. Each crumb will fuel a few more minutes of blind wandering, regardless of the consumer.

For once the crumbs had a distinctly French tinge, coming from an Almond Croissant rather than the standard homemade sandwich. Both man and bird appreciate the variety, as the lukewarm flakes travel down their throats. A pointless treat, with no cause nor lasting impact.

He looks up at the peeling barrier protecting man from river, as the city and the City mingle on the other side of the Thames. Both leeching from each other in the interlocking web of a modern city, albeit one with much more consciousness.

Across the river, Globe House lurks with a turquoise roof promising far more empire than it could ever deliver. The vague layers rise out of the greenery promising yet another secret yet known Central London garden. The legions of workers choose their poison: awkward interactions yet bonus oxygen, or concrete anonymity across the river. It doesn't matter.

As the overpriced croissant comes to an end, a roaring can be heard far off upriver, west. A boat full of tourists paying to see the anonymous windows where the man and his kind sacrifice themselves on the altar of almighty Great British Pound. No, too high up. A helicopter tour offering the same? No, approaching too fast. A chinook, or something similar representing the fading remnants of that aforementioned empire? No, too large, too white, too fast.

It's a plane. A large plane, a 747 or something. Pure white, with the tips of wings and tail tipped in bright red blood. Or paint, depending on your timeframe.

The man stares at this out of place absurdity, the sheer mass of it making a mockery of the surrounding buildings. If there is a creator they must be ignorant of video composition, the plane does clearly not belong at this altitude, seemingly overlapping with the waterfront buildings.

And yet, as the monster approaches, it is slowing. The moments are ticking slower, but the speed reduction is undeniable. By the time the right wing clips the bicycle wheel known as the London Eye, there is no going back. Perhaps the pilot has a moment of lucidity, as the plane begins to point upwards, a desperate last attempt at breathing room? Irrelevant.

The nose rises, the plane freezes in the air. The river is silent, road traffic slowed, ten thousand office workers staring at this intruder in their air. Time progresses. Nothing can pause forever. The plane drops, falling as if through molasses, inching closer to impact with the endless buildings, each with a complex, interweaving, yet uninteresting history.

## Chapter 1

Eyes open. It is dark, not midday. It is breakfast, not lunch. It is North London, not Central.

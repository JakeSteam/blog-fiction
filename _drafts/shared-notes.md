## Participants

A: Office worker. Follows authority, likes process, logic, science.
B: Artist. Creative, spiritual, willing to try things.
C: Student. Reclusive, quiet, private. Scared.
D: Athlete. Extrovert, competitive, tries to be one step ahead of all.

## Researchers

X: Success at all costs, need to get this study completed for doctorate! Low morals, high motivation.
Y: Empathy. These are humans we're experimenting on, this really isn't ethical.

## Overall story beats

* Dreams coalesce with a shared stranger in the background. This stranger becomes more in the foreground, as it progresses we discover every candidate has a depressive background. 
* This depression relapses. Candidate C reports it primarily, with D intermittently. A & B fall together.
* Why is there a stranger in dreams? This is a **shared subsubsubconscious**. Suicide and depression are an evolutionary requirement to avoid overpopulation.
* The solution to overpopulation is to spread this realisation via the chemical itself, and of course take the "required actions" as an individual once your usefulness is fulfilled.

## Pacing 

* Week 1: Typical reports, slight alignment
* Week 2: Shared symptoms, the dark man. He is here. He is impacting. Candidates request higher doses?
* Week 3: Candidates begin dropping out due to the fear, we keep one of the couple and one of the remaining.
* Week 4: The possessions begin. Changes in personality, in sleep habits, in the world. The dreams have monologues with speeches about how "he" is the basis of humankind, how this is not what he intended, how it is all wrong. The researcher succumbs. Too much exposure is fatal. Final notes aren't entirely sane.

## Constraints

* No physical descriptions (of physical characters)
* No informal language, except in quotes

Epidextrin is the latest meditative sleep aid from Eleng Medicines. Research shows that by connecting more deeply with their subconscious, patients can experience longer, healthier, and more refreshing sleep. With no hallucinogenic effects, Epidextrin strengthens the patient's subconscious thoughts whilst asleep, and is currently undergoing final checks before FDA approval.

## Methodology

This 4-week study study is conducted by researchers the University of Surrey, and receives partial funding from Eleng Medicines and Xhion Industries. 

The study aims to discover the effects of Epidextrin upon sleep quality and quantity, with special focus paid to the dreams participants encounter. The overall goal is to determine whether Epidextrin is suitable for prescription as a sleep aid, and whether it is suitable for prescription as a recreational dream enhancer.

Approximately 4-5 participants will initially receive 30mg doses of Epidextrin twice a day, raising up to 100mg at the researcher's discretion. Whilst this compound is not expected to cause any health complications, there is currently inconclusive evidence of a strengthening impact on the subconscious, particularly during sleep. Medical personnel will be on hand 24/7 during this study in case of any complications.

If selected, participants will spend 6 nights per week (Sun - Fri night) within the study dormitory for the duration of the 4-week study period. They will be administered 30mg of Epidextrin before sleep and immediately before their morning daily interview. Throughout the designated sleeping hours (23:00 - 08:00) all candidates will be secured in isolated rooms, with a sleep supporting frequency of 88Khz played consistently to encourage both dream presence and memory persistence. During the unstudied night (Saturday) all participants will be accommodated in a hotel, to allow researchers to collate records and avoid participants settling into a passive routine.

The morning daily interview will consist of a discussion of the subject's dreams from the previous night, followed by a comparison to their observed sleep behaviour. Whilst not under observation or in an interview, candidates will continue to attend their jobs, hobbies, and other engagements. 

Monitoring and interviews will be conducted by the authors of this paper, referred to as Researcher X & Y.

## Candidates

Whilst the study received 15 applications before the deadline, 6 candidates were excluded as unsuitable. This was typically due to an inability or unwillingness to adhere to the study's necessarily highly monitored sleep requirements, however 2 candidates were excluded due to concerns over conflicts with their pre-existing health conditions. 

To adhere to GDPR requirements, the 9 valid candidates have been anonymised using alphabetical pseudonyms (A-I). From these, four (A-D) were selected as acceptable candidates for this research. Note that the initial list has been rearranged to place the valid candidates at the start, for ease of alphabetisation consistency.  

Detailed rejection reasons and motivations for final selections unfortunately cannot be shared publicly, however any researchers attempting a similar study should use their academic email to contact this study's authors for further information.

### **Candidate A** (Selected)

Candidate A is a 31-year-old office worker. They applied for the survey primarily to support their long term partner (Candidate B), whom they occasionally ("maybe one night in 3") share a bed with.

The candidate has no history of any mental aberrations (sleep related or otherwise), and reports typically sleeping for 7 hours without any disturbances. Candidate reports dreaming 3-4 nights per week.

### **Candidate B** (Selected)

Candidate B is a 28-year-old freelance artist. They applied for the survey for personal spiritual purposes, as a "way to help aline [sic] my inner self". They occasionally ("once every week or two") share a bed with their partner (Candidate A), but otherwise sleep alone

The candidate has no history of mental health problems, however reports often feeling "disconnected" and "space out" for several minutes during a day (this symptom has been corroborated by Candidate A). They report experiencing both lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis, however not within the last 18 months. Candidate reports dreaming almost every night.

### **Candidate C** (Selected)

Candidate C is a 21-year-old student. They applied for the survey primarily for the financial compensation, and state an interest in their subconscious mind's processes.

The candidate has a history of minor mental health problems, with depression and disassociation occurring relatively regularly within their medical history. Despite this, they are currently an acceptably low risk candidate due to their measurably stable composition during the interview. They report sleeping for 7-8 hours per night, typically alone, with no disturbances besides external stimuli. Candidate reports dreaming somewhat rarely (1-2 nights/week), and emphasised the intensity of their dreams.

### **Candidate D** (Selected)

Candidate D is a 26-year-old athlete. They applied for the survey to improve their mental and physical health. 

The candidate reports a stable sleep schedule of 6-7 hours per night. This candidate did report minor (medicated) issues with depression during teenage years, with no recent relapses. Candidate reports dreaming 2-3 nights per week.

### **Candidate E** (Rejected)

### **Candidate F** (Rejected)

### **Candidate G** (Rejected)

### **Candidate H** (Rejected)

### **Candidate I** (Rejected)

## Week 1

As described in the study's methodology, candidates were interviewed shortly after waking each morning. Transcripts here are not complete, and only contain sections relevant to this study. Additionally, typical small talk and questions around the study, logistics, etc are generally excised. 

Please note that the researcher notes at the end of each day's interviews are informal, may be off-topic, and must be removed before external distribution. 

### Monday

#### Participant A

* X: Good morning, A.
* A: Hey!
* X: Sleep well?
* A: Yeah great thanks, those are memory foam mattresses right? We were going to get one, but B is on the fence.
* X: Great. Please tell me about your dreams last night.
* A: Right, of course. I had 2. You want both?
* X: Yes please.
* A: Okay, first one. I was on this beach, except it kind of had a border to it in the water? Like, a solid barrier, like The Truman Show except way more visible. Anyway, I was standing in the middle of the beach trying to work out how far away this wall is, but I kept losing track since the sand wasn't- I dunno, wasn't flat? That's it, I kept trying then it ended.
* X: Thank you. And the 2nd dream?
* A: Does it mean anything? Something about hurdles in life maybe?
* X: Dreams are just your subconscious shuffling ideas around, I wouldn't recommend reading too deeply into them. The 2nd dream?
* A: Alright, sure. Second dream B and I were up at B's parent's house, over in the countryside, and we were just sitting around - sorry, we as in me, B, both parents - talking about golf. I don't even play golf, but I totally knew what we were discussing somehow. This went on for a bit, then everyone went to sleep in their chairs. The end.
* X: Great, thank you. Anything else you'd like to tell me about last night?
* A: Nope, I slept well, thanks. One thing though, I've got to ask, how are you guys paying so much? We're just sleeping.
* X: Well, the results will help determine whether Epidextrin can be brought to market, if it has the desired effects then it will have significant quality of life improvements for many.
* A: Sure, yeah, I get why you're doing the study. But why so much?
* X: It's actually quite hard to find people able to spend every night either here or the hotel for nearly a month. That, plus all the medical exclusions, mean it's a pretty fair price.
* A: Alright if you say so, feels like I'm getting paid for two days of work per day this month! The upfront payment was great too, thanks for that. 
* X: No problem, see you tonight.

#### Participant B

* X: Good morning, B.
* B: Morning.
* X: Sleep well?
* B: It was OK, that ambient sound was very cool, really helped me relax.
* X: I'm glad. Did you manage to dream last night?
* B: I think so? I usually dream these totally abstract landscapes or cityscapes, but this one was even vaguer than usual. I was this kind of floating... blob of consciousness? There were others floating near me too, but it was just an innate sense of them, I couldn't see or sense them in any tangible way. It was like when you close your eyes, and you see areas of almost colour flowing. It was peaceful.
* X: Perfect, thank you. 
* B: Do you think I was connecting to someone? Something?
* X: It's impossible for me to say, it's your dream.
* B: That's true, thank you.

#### Participant C

* X: Good morning, C.
* C: Hi.
* X: Sleep well?
* C: Yep. Would you like my dreams?
* X: Yes please.
* C: OK. First one I was eating a pizza and every bite seemed to make it get bigger. I kept eating faster and faster, and the single slice ended up the size of... that door (C pointed to the interview room door, a typical internal wooden door). I then stopped eating.
* X: Great, thank you. You said dreams, are there more?
* C: Yep. Other dream was back at school, maybe 15-16 years old. I was taking an exam, but the letters on the page just wouldn't... work? The lines didn't look right, they didn't connect properly, it was as if they were clearly English characters in isolation, but when together they became something else. It was unsettling, but not exactly a nightmare.
* X: Thank you.

#### Participant D

* X: Hello, D.
* D: Hey hey X, morning.
* X: Sleep well?
* D: Yeah thank you, it was really nice having such a distraction-free room y'know? That speaker was a bit annoying at first, but I think it helped once I adjusted.
* X: Great. Did you have any dreams?
* D: You're going to analyse them right? Is there a right answer?
* X: I wouldn't say analyse. I'd say collating, but no, there is definitely no right answer besides an honest answer.
* D: I understand, what happens if I show no changes? If my dreams are unchanged throughout?
* X: A lack of change isn't a lack of result. If that happens, it will help determine how widely applicable Epidextrin is. Both affected and unaffected individuals may be invited back for future studies.
* D: Very clever, presumably the intention is to disincentivise pretending it had an effect? I know you can't confirm or deny, don't worry. So, my dreams. First dream was probably the Freudian gold standard, I was back at home, as a teenager, watching TV with my Dad. We haven't spoken in a few years, but it's a pretty healthy relationship I'd say. It was some sort of sports TV, and the dream just continued with us peacefully watching together for maybe 10 minutes. Nothing else happened.
* X: That's perfect, thank you. Anything else you'd like to add?
* D: Nope, see you tomorrow Doc.

#### Research Notes

* X: All 4 participants seemed pretty upbeat, and who can blame them, they're getting paid to dream. Bit easier than postgrad work, right? 
* Y: Sure, I guess. 
* X: You guess? You saw the tapes, A is pretty sure they've found an infinite money hack, and B probably feels about the same.
* Y: Yeah. I don't know, I couldn't do it. Having a stranger watching you sleep all night, it's not natural.
* X: Natural? They're pumped up on Epi, if they knew the street value of that stuff they'd probably try and sell their blood to China.
* Y: Why China?
* X: You know where the money comes from, don't act innocent. We're closing our eyes and opening our hands to get our doctorates, be honest to yourself.
* Y: Whatever. I'm here for the science.

### Tuesday

* Again, typical disparate dreams, some A&B alignment.

#### Participant A

* Y: Hello A.
* A: Hello!
* Y: How'd you sleep last night?
* A: Yeah, really well, thank you. I was telling your colleague yesterday about how nice the mattress here is, it seems to have got even softer since last night? Maybe I was just more tired.
* Y: Maybe. I'm glad you're sleeping well, do you have any dreams you could tell me about?
* A: For sure. It was kinda similar to the first one I had here, do you need me to describe that one again?
* Y: No, that's OK, we have transcripts don't worry. Just the new one would be helpful.
* A: Oh okay. Alright, so it was also on a beach, but all the Truman Show-y stuff was gone, and instead I was digging for something. I wasn't going crazy though, I was digging literally grain by grain. Oh my god, describing it, I've totally realised why I dreamt about it. Do you know Calvin and Hobbes?
* Y: Of course! I used to be super jealous of Calvin. 
* A: Me too. You know that one comic where he says he was counting rocks or something, and the dream was so boring it woke him up? I was thinking about that yesterday for some reason, maybe because of my beach dream. Dreams influencing dreams, sorry if this is messing with your data.
* Y: No, no, it's alright, dreams aren't exactly a conscious decision. That's really helpful, thank you. Is there anything else you wanted to share?
* A: That's all I think, see you tomorrow.
* Y: Bye.

#### Participant B

* Y: Hello B.
* B: Hey, morning.
* Y: Did you sleep well?
* B: Yeah, thank you. It's a little odd knowing other people are dreaming in rooms around me, almost makes it feel like a communal experience y'know? 
* Y: Sure. Did you have any dreams?
* B: I had a snippet?
* Y: Of a dream?
* B: Yeah, like a freeze-frame or a Polaroid picture. It's a bit of a weird one. You know hundreds and thousands? Those little colourful things for cakes and things?
* Y: Sure, sugar strands.
* B: Exactly, little sugary things. So I saw a picture of a handful of those falling onto this giant tub of ice cream. Maybe I was just hungry or something, but when I say giant tub, I mean *giant*. The size of a swimming pool, and all of it had hundreds and thousands falling onto it.
* Y: And it was just a single image, nothing happened?
* B: Yup.
* Y: Alright, that's helpful thanks. Anything else you wanted to add?
* B: No, thanks for your time.
* Y: You too.

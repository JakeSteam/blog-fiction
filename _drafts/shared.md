summary / teaser

## Appendix 1: Study

* 2 week study 
* Monitored sleep, observation of sleep behaviour (and brain waves) vs reported dreams
* Goal is to find correlation between observed brain waves and dream topic
* Uses new analysis technique, good likelihood of new results

## Appendix 2: Subjects

Whilst the study received 15 applications before the deadline, 6 candidates were excluded as unsuitable. This was typically due to an inability or unwillingness to adhere to the study's necessarily highly monitored sleep requirements, however 2 candidates were excluded due to concerns over conflicts with their pre-existing health conditions. 

To adhere to GDPR requirements, the 9 valid candidates have been anonymised using alphabetical pseudonyms (A-I). From these, four (A-D) were selected as acceptable candidates for this research. Note that the initial list has been rearranged to place the valid candidates at the start, for ease of alphabetisation consistency.  

Detailed rejection reasons and motivations for final selections unfortunately cannot be shared publicly, however any researchers attempting a similar study should use their academic email to contact this study's authors for further information.

**Candidate A** (Selected)

Candidate A is a 31-year-old office worker. They applied for the survey primarily to support their partner (Candidate B), whom they typically share a bed with.

The candidate has no history of any mental aberrations (sleep related or otherwise), and reports typically sleeping for 7 hours without any disturbances.

**Candidate B** (Selected)

Candidate B is a 28-year-old freelance artist. They applied for the survey for personal spiritual purposes, to "way to help aline [sic] my inner self". They typically share a bed with their partner (Candidate A).

The candidate has no history of mental health problems, however reports often feeling "disconnected" and "space out" for several minutes during a day (this symptom has been corroborated by Candidate A). They report experiencing both lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis, however not within the last 18 months.

**Candidate C** (Selected)

**Candidate E** (Rejected)

**Candidate F** (Rejected)

**Candidate G** (Rejected)

**Candidate H** (Rejected)

**Candidate I** (Rejected)

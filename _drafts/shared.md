## Notes

### Appendix 1: Study

This study is conducted by researchers the University of Surrey, and receives partial funding from Eleng Medicines and Xhion Industries. 

This study aims to discover the effects of Epidextrin upon sleep quality and quantity, with special focus paid to the dreams participants encounter. The overall goal is to determine whether Epidextrin is suitable for prescription as a sleep aid, and whether it is suitable for prescription as a recreational dream enhancer.

Approximately 4-5 candidates will initially receive 30mg doses of Epidextrin twice a day, raising up to 100mg at the researcher's discretion. Whilst this compound is not expected to cause any health complications, there is currently inconclusive evidence of a strengthening impact on the subconscious, particularly during sleep. Medical personnel will be on hand 24/7 during this study in case of any complications.

If selected, candidates will spend 6 nights per week (Sun - Fri night) within the study dormitory. They will be administered 30mg of Epidextrin before sleep and immediately before their morning daily interview. Throughout the designated sleeping hours (23:00 - 08:00) all candidates will be secured in isolated rooms, with a sleep supporting frequency of 88Khz played consistently to encourage both dream presence and memory persistence.

The morning daily interview will consist of a discussion of the subject's dreams from the previous night, followed by a comparison to their observed sleep behaviour. Whilst not under observation or in an interview, candidates will continue to attend their jobs, hobbies, and other engagements. 

### Appendix 2: Subjects

Whilst the study received 15 applications before the deadline, 6 candidates were excluded as unsuitable. This was typically due to an inability or unwillingness to adhere to the study's necessarily highly monitored sleep requirements, however 2 candidates were excluded due to concerns over conflicts with their pre-existing health conditions. 

To adhere to GDPR requirements, the 9 valid candidates have been anonymised using alphabetical pseudonyms (A-I). From these, four (A-D) were selected as acceptable candidates for this research. Note that the initial list has been rearranged to place the valid candidates at the start, for ease of alphabetisation consistency.  

Detailed rejection reasons and motivations for final selections unfortunately cannot be shared publicly, however any researchers attempting a similar study should use their academic email to contact this study's authors for further information.

**Candidate A** (Selected)

Candidate A is a 31-year-old office worker. They applied for the survey primarily to support their partner (Candidate B), whom they typically share a bed with.

The candidate has no history of any mental aberrations (sleep related or otherwise), and reports typically sleeping for 7 hours without any disturbances.

**Candidate B** (Selected)

Candidate B is a 28-year-old freelance artist. They applied for the survey for personal spiritual purposes, to "way to help aline [sic] my inner self". They typically share a bed with their partner (Candidate A).

The candidate has no history of mental health problems, however reports often feeling "disconnected" and "space out" for several minutes during a day (this symptom has been corroborated by Candidate A). They report experiencing both lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis, however not within the last 18 months.

**Candidate C** (Selected)

Candidate C is a 21-year-old student. They applied for the survey primarily for the financial compensation, and state an interest in their subconscious mind's processes.

The candidate has a history of minor mental health problems, with depression and disassociation occurring relatively regularly within their medical history. Despite this, they are currently an acceptably low risk candidate due to their measurably stable composition during the interview. They report sleeping for 7-8 hours per night, typically alone, with no disturbances besides external stimuli.    

**Candidate D** (Selected)

Candidate D is a 26-year-old athlete. They applied for the survey to improve their mental and physical health. 

The candidate reports a stable sleep schedule of 6-7 hours per night. This candidate did report minor (medicated) issues with depression during teenage years, with no recent relapses.

**Candidate E** (Rejected)

**Candidate F** (Rejected)

**Candidate G** (Rejected)

**Candidate H** (Rejected)

**Candidate I** (Rejected)

## Lab notes 

### Week 1, Monday

Write-up of Sunday night's behaviour reports, and the participant's reported dreams.

* Typical disparate dreams, as you would expect

### Week 1, Tuesday

* Again, typical disparate dreams

### Week 1, Wednesday

* No A & B correlation, none with C & D

### Week 1, Thursday

* A & B dreams aligned, C & D zero alignment still 

### Week 1, Friday

* A & B stay aligned, C & D zero alignment (besides subtexts)

### Week 1, Saturday

* A & B lose alignment, A & D somewhat alignment

## Overall story beats

* Dreams coalesce with a shared stranger in the background. This stranger becomes more in the foreground, as it progresses we discover every candidate has a depressive background. 
* This depression relapses. Candidate C reports it primarily, with D intermittently. A & B fall together.
* Why is there a stranger in dreams? This is a **shared subsubsubconscious**. Suicide and depression are an evolutionary requirement to avoid overpopulation.
* The solution to overpopulation is to spread this realisation via the chemical itself, and of course take the "required actions" as an individual once your usefulness is fulfilled.

## Pacing 

* Week 1: Typical reports, slight alignment
* Week 2: All fall into step
* Week 3: Shared symptoms, the dark man
* Week 4: He comes closer, he is becoming a problem
* Week 5: He is here. He is impacting. Candidates request higher doses?
* Week 6: Candidates begin dropping out due to the fear, we keep one of the couple and one of the remaining.
* Week 7: The possessions begin. Changes in personality, in sleep habits, in the world. The dreams have monologues with speeches about how "he" is the basis of humankind, how this is not what he intended, how it is all wrong.
* Week 8: The researcher succumbs. Too much exposure is fatal. Final notes aren't entirely sane.

## Constraints

* No physical descriptions (of physical characters)
* No informal language, except in quotes

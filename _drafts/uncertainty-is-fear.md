Fragments of something around uncertainty, fear, failure, and anxiety.

The most stressful times of my life have been those with uncertainty. It doesn't matter if it's a good thing or a bad thing, a period of uncertainty where you can have no impact on the outcome is absolutely horrific.

## Interviewing

When interviewing for new jobs, seeing if you'll keep your own, or even just waiting for a confirmation, the uncertainty is the painful part. Applying is easy. Chatting to other professionals is easy. Waiting an unknown period of time to see what direction your life is going to take? Not easy.

Engineers that interview at multiple places at once clearly do not feel the same way. Perhaps there is an element of diffusion, where being involved in multiple processes divides the same level of stress between each.

## Current experience

Regardless of the cause of this wait, the stress of waiting for a call, or an email, is absurd.

Recently I had (and am still having!) the most painful uncertainty wait yet, waiting to hear about a potentially negative outcome. I was amazed what an impact it had on me, and I wanted to reflect on *why* it's been such a negative experience.

I've interviewed for plenty of jobs, each obviously with multiple interview stages, and the stress had a distinctly different flavour to my current experience.

So what does this shitty experience feel like, and what is it?

## Anxiety

Well, I reckon it's good old anxiety. Without Googling, the symptoms are fear of the future, inability to enjoy *anything*, trouble sleeping, and inability to focus.

Looking at [the NHS page for anxiety](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/feelings-and-symptoms/anxiety-disorder-signs/), it lists the symptoms:
> * feeling restless or on edge
> * being irritable
> * getting tired easily
> * having difficulty concentrating or feeling your mind goes blank
> * having difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep
> * having tense muscles
